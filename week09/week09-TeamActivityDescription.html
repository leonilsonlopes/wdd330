        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will introduce you to manipulating transitions and
          transforms with Javascript. We will also get experience listening for
          key presses in the browser. The challenge for today again comes from a
          free javascript course from Wes Bos
          <a href="https://javascript30.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Javascript30</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

          <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Download the
                <a
                  href="../solutions/week09/javascript30-drums.zip"

                  >starter code</a
                >
                and add the Javascript necessary to make the appropriate sound
                file play when the corresponding key is pressed.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Make it quick.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may have noticed that if you press a key rapidly the sound
                file does not immediately re-play. Modify your code to make the
                sound restart each time the same key is pressed. (Hint use
                <code>console.dir</code> to take a good look at the
                <kbd>audio</kbd> element)
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->

            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Style it.
              </p>

              <p>
                Add the <kbd>playing</kbd> class to a button when it's key is
                pressed. Then remove it after the appropriate length of time.

              <p>
                Each time a key is pressed move the corresponding button down

              <p>Reset it</p>
              <p>
                After 10 presses of a key, reset the position of it's button.

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
