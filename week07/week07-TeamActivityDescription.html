        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will have us look one more time at the Great hikes
          application. This week we will practice using localStorage, and get
          another opportunity to think about the architecture of our code by
          adding a comments system for the hikes.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

              <p>
                If you don't have a working copy of the Great hikes app then you
                can pull down
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261/tree/gh-pages/solutions/week05"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noreferrer"
                  >this version of the working code</a
                >
                as a starting point (<a href="../solutions/week05/hikes5.zip"
                  >Zip archive</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                Review the code to refresh your memory on the structure we have
                used. Discuss with your group what methods and properties you
                might need to implement your comments. A comment should consist
                of at least the name of the hike it is for, a date, and the
                actual text of the comment. You will also need a comment
                <kbd>type</kbd> to use as a key for when we store these to local
                storage.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                Type? This is just to allow us to re-use this code. Later you
                might want to expand on this application and add something like
                favorite parks or climbs, etc. It would be nice to re-use this
                module for each of those. Adding a <kbd>type</kbd> flag allows
                us to add comments for different things and grab all of them or
                keep them separate.
              </p>
              <p>
                It might help here to write out a list of steps that need to
                happen in order to capture a comment. A sample starter list can
                be found below.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  When the app loads we see a list of all hikes...below we
                  should also see a list of all comments with type:hike.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a hike is touched it will show us the details for that
                  hike. We should also see any comments for that hike, and an
                  input and button to add a new comment.
                </li>
                <li>When the submit comment button is touched...</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                From this we can start to infer some of the methods and
                properties we will need:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A <code>getAllComments</code> and
                  <code>renderCommentList</code> method.
                </li>
                <li>A comment <code>type</code> to use as a key.</li>
                <li>A <code>filterCommentsByName</code> method.</li>
                <li>An array to hold all of our comments.</li>
                <li>
                  A comment should look something like this:
                  <pre><code class="lang-js">
    const newComment = {
      name: hikeName,
      date: new Date(),
      content: comment
    };
                    </code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>A method to add an event listener to the submit button.</li>
                <li>An <code>addComment</code> method</li>
                <li>...</li>
              </ul>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Build out the objects and modules decided on in step 1.</p>
              <p>
                Create a new module for our Comments code. Create a class with a
                constructor to act as the controller. The constructor should set
                a local property called <code>type</code> when the class is
                instantiated.
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  As you start thinking about implementing your module...think
                  back to the Todo list we made. This is in many ways similar to
                  that. We need a form to gather some user input, we need a
                  button with a listener to store that into an array (and
                  eventually LocalStorage), and we need to display a list of our
                  comments. The biggest difference here is that we don't always
                  want to show the entry form, and we want our module to be
                  reusable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Still there are enough simularities that you could probably
                  use your ToDo code as a starting point for this. A couple of
                  recommendations for changes:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    We could end up with more than one type of comments, and
                    more than one list of comments. If you haven't already, take
                    the methods for adding and removing comments and our comment
                    list and build an additional class around them. Call it
                    something like
                    <code>CommentModel</code>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Depending on how you hide/show your comment entry form you
                    could end up with issues with your listeners. If you start
                    getting funny behavior try using
                    <code>element.ontouchend = callback</code>, instead of
                    <code>element.addEventListener('touchend', callback)</code>
                    when you attach the listener to your button. This will
                    ensure that you only ever have one listener attached to the
                    button at a time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    One additional change (for the stretch) is that we need to
                    include the name of the hike the comment is for in our saved
                    comment. Consider how you will get that information into
                    your listener so that the callback can use it.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <p>
                Create a method in the class called <kbd>showCommentsList</kbd>.
                For now it can just return some static text or log something out
                to the console.
              </p>
              <p>
                Insert your comment class into the hike class by adding a
                <code>new</code> instance of the comment class in the
                constructor. Call the <kbd>showCommentsList</kbd> method when
                the list of hikes is shown to make sure that you have things
                connected up correctly.
              </p>
              <!-- <p class="callout">
                If you are unclear on how to do this...go look at the existing
                <kbd>hikesController</kbd> class. Pay attention to how we
                inserted the hike model and view into the controller. Something
                similar would work well to bring our comments module
                (controller) in. Once the commentsController is part of the
                hikesController we have access to all of the class methods and
                can call them when needed (such as after we show the list of
                hikes).
              </p> -->
              <p>
                When you are looking at a specific hike it should allow you to
                enter a new comment, and should show all the comments below that
                form.
              </p>
              <p>
                Write the rest of the code to implement your commenting system.
                For now just store your comments in an array.
              </p>

                Store It.
              </p>
              <p>
                Write the model code to store and retrieve the comments to/from
                local storage.

                When you are looking at a hike details screen you should only
                see the comments for that hike. When you are looking at all
                hikes you should see all comments of type hike. Change your code
                to support this.

                able to enter a comment, when you are looking at all hikes you
                should not be able to enter a new comment. Change your code to

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
