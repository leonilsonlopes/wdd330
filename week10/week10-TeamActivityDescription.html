        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This week we will revisit the topics of MVC and Fetch to build a
          simple app to show any earthquake within a certain radius of the
          location of the app. To do this we will also have to access the
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >Geolocation interface</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

          <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Open
                <a href="../resources/quakes.html" target="_blank"
                  >the quakes activity</a
                >
                and work through step 9.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Step 10.
              </p>
              <p>
                Create a functional app by finishing step 10.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Style it.
              </p>

              <p>
                Add CSS to make the application look and work better.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Settings
              </p>

              <p>
                It would be great if we could specify the radius we would like
                to include in the query for earthquakes. Make it so. You might
                also allow the use to indicate the dates they would like to
                search over as well.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Back button</p>
              <p>
                We can drill down into a quake's details...but we currently have
                no way to get back to the list other than a refresh of the page.
                Add a 'Back' button.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Routing</p>
              <p>
                What if we wanted to add more functionality? A Routing system
                would make this easier. See if you can take the
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261/tree/gh-pages/examples/spa-example-complete"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noreferrer"
                  >Routing module</a
                >
                from the SPA example app that we did earlier and integrate it
                into this app.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261/tree/gh-pages/examples/quakes"
            target="_blank"

          of this project. (Or

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
